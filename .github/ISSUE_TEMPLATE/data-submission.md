Please be aware that your private data will stay private. We understand privacy issues, and HSF will NOT release any dataset on its own. Your MRIs will stay private, securely stored in specific storage infrastructures inaccessible from the Internet at the Commissariat Ã  l'Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives (CEA) of Paris-Saclay, France. Your MRIs will ONLY be used for offline training of our Deep Learning models.

**Do you open this issue because of an issue in HSF? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is with HSF leading you to gather new segmented MRIs (e.g. bad segmentation in pathological subjects).

**Is the dataset yours? How to cite it?**
A clear and concise description of where does the data comes from, and the conditions to use the MRIs.

**Dataset description**
A clear and concise description of any included MRI (e.g. 71 T1w MRIs, MP2RAGE, 0.8*0.8*0.8mm) with manually corrected segmentations (HSF bagging accurate as base).

**How to access the dataset?**
Please provide a link if the dataset is public, or provide a way to discuss this in private if the dataset has to stay private.
