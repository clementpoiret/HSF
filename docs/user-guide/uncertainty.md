# Uncertainty Estimations

When HSF is used in `bagging` mode or with test-time augmentation (see the [configuration page](configuration.md)),
it is possible to estimate the uncertainty of the predicted segmentation, notably through the *Aleatoric Uncertainty*
which depends on noise or randomness in the input testing image.

## Aleatoric Uncertainty

Aleatoric uncertainty is also known as statistical uncertainty, and is representative of unknowns that differ each time we run the same experiment[^1].

Given a set $Y$ of $i$ predictions, in HSF the voxel-wise Aleatoric Uncertainty $H(Y^i|X)$ is defined as[^2]:

$$
H(Y^i|X) \approx - \sum^M_{m=1}{\hat{p}^i_m \ln \hat{p}^i_m}
$$

where $\hat{p}^i_m$ is the frequency of the $m$th unique value in $Y^i$.
